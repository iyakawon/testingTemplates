Description: Here we describe various tricks we have come up
    with to make some of our internal reports look nicer and 
    more consistent, to encourage uptake to of the use of 
    report templates (and thus, hopefully, improve reproducibility).
    Some topics covered include banners/logos for MS Word output, 
    recasting the preamble into a "From: To:" letter in MS Word, 
    and the use of citations, among others.

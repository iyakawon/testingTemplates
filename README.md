# testingTemplates

The goal of testingTemplates is to bundle up various
tricks associated with document modifications (e.g., 
adding logos to MS Word output) to RMarkdown output. 

This package differs from most in that it has fewer
functions - much of what it consists of is external
files (in extdata) and vignettes describing their 
use.
